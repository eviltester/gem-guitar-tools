Guitar Reference      - Reference Manual

This document  is  the  reference  manual  for  the  Guitar  Reference
Program. It is not intended  to  be  a  tutorial  since the program is
designed to be used and experimented with, refer to this document only
to find out more about a certain feature, or if you are uncertain what
a feature does, or even if you think that there are more features that
you don't know about.

This manual is under constant  revision,  as  is the program, and both
will mature and improve over time.

Enjoy.

1.1 Loading Scales
------------------
        Loading the scales is done by selecting 'Load Scales' from the
File menu bar.

        The file selector will appear and you select which scales file
to load. Choosing cancel returns  you  to  the program with no changes
made.

        This will replace the scales currently in memory.

        A Scales file can be set  to  load  when the program is run by
setting the scales path in the defaults file. See the Defaults section
for more details.


1.2 Saving Scales
-----------------
        Saving scales is done  by  selecting  the 'Save Scales' option
from the Files menu bar.

        The file selector dialogue will appear and you choose the name
of the scales file to  write  to.  Choosing  cancel returns you to the
program without saving the scales.

        If the file already exists then  a dialogue will appear giving
you the option of saving to this file or cancelling the operation.

1.3 Selecting a scale from memory
----------------------------------
        Selecting a scale already in  memory  is  done by choosing the
'Select Scale' option in the  Scales  menu  or by pressing 'Alternate'
and 's' at the same time.

        A text window will appear with the available scales displayed.

        You can choose one of these scales in a number of ways.

        * double click on the scale name
        * single click on the scale so that it is highlighted and then
          close the window
        * Use the keyboard cursor keys to highlight the scale name and
          then press 'Return'

       If a scale name  has  been  highlighted,  clicking once on the
scale name will de-select it or pressing 'Undo' will also deselect it.

        Leaving the  window  with  no  scale  highlighted,  either  by
closing the window or by pressing return, means that no scale has been
chosen and the same scale will be displayed.

1.4 Saving a scale to memory
----------------------------
        Saving a Scale  to  memory  is  done  by  selecting the 'Store
Scale' option in the 'Scales' menu.

        A dialogue will appear:

        +---------------------------------------+
        ! ---                                   !
        ! \?/                                   !
        !  V   This will overwrite the          !
        !      current version of the scale     !
        !      held in memory                   !
        !                                       !
        !        +=======+  +--------+          !
        !        + Store +  + Cancel +          !
        !        +=======+  +--------+          !
        +---------------------------------------+

        Clicking on Cancel will abort the operation.

        Clicking on Store or pressing  'Return' will continue with the
Store operation.

1.5 Renaming a scale
--------------------
        Renaming a  scale  is  done  by  selecting  'Rename'  from the
'Scales' menu bar.

        A dialogue will appear with  an  editable  field for the scale
name. Clicking on OK or  pressing  'Return'   renames the scale to the
text in the editable field. Pressing  Cancel aborts the  operation and
the Scale name remains unchanged.

1.6 Saving a scale under a different name
-----------------------------------------
        Scales can be saved  under  different  names  by selecting the
'Store As ...' option from the Scales menu.

        A dialogue appears with an editable  field for the scale name.
Clicking on OK or  pressing  'Return'  will  continue with the Storing
operation. Clicking on Cancel aborts  the  operation  and the scale is
not stored to memory.

        The program checks to see if a scale with the same name exists
and if so tells you. You are  then  given the option of cancelling the
operation, renaming the scale or of storing it.

        The program also checks to see if a scale exists with the same
notes and if so the same dialogue is presented.

        This operation is fundamentally different from Rename since is
creates a new  scale  in  memory  with  the  edited  name  rather than
renaming the current scale.

        This operation is useful for adding new scales to memory.

1.7 Sorting Scales
------------------
        Sorting Scales is done when  the  'Sort Names' option has been
ticked on the Scales menu.

        Sorting scales  is  only  done  when  Selecting  a  Scale from
memory. There may be a slight delay before selecting a scale when this
option is first used.

1.8 Deleting a scale
--------------------
        A scale can be  deleted  by  choosing  'Delete Scale' from the
Scales menu bar.

        The text window will be  displayed  with  a list of scales. In
order to delete one highlight it and exit the window. If the window is
exited without a highlighted scale then nothing is deleted.

        Highlighting a scale  can  be  done  by  clicking  on a scale,
another single click on the scale will unhighlight it. Double clicking
on the scale name will delete that scale.

        The scale can also  be  deleted  by  using the keyboard cursor
keys to highlight the  scale  name   and   then   pressing 'Return' to
leave the  window.  'Undo'   will    cause   any   highlighted   scale
to  be unhighlighted.


1.9 Creating a new scale
------------------------
1.9.1 Adding notes
        Notes can be added to a scale in a number of ways.

        * Clicking on any of the notes on the Notes pull down menu.
          The notes in the current scale are shown with a tick to
          their left.
        * Double clicking on any fret on the screen will add that
          note.
        * Single clicking on any fret will bring up a dialogue
          of information about that fret. One of the boxes of
          information tells you whether or not that note is
          in the scale, highlighting the YES box will add
          that note to the scale.


1.9.2 Deleting notes
        Notes can be removed from a scale in a number of ways.

        * Clicking on any of the notes on the Notes pull down menu.
          The notes in the current scale are shown with a tick to
          their left, those that are not have no tick.
        * Double clicking on any note on the screen will remove
          that note.
        * Single clicking on any fret will bring up a dialogue
          of information about that fret. One of the boxes
          of information tells you whether or not that note is
          in the scale, highlighting the NO box will remove
          that note from the scale.

1.A Printing the scales
-----------------------
        The Scale can be  printed  by  clicking  on the 'Print' option
from the File Menu.

        The printer name lists the  current  printer driver loaded. To
load a new driver click on this portion of the screen.

        The text in the Header window  is  printed before the scale. A
number of variables can be written in here.

        The text in the Trailer window  is printed after the scale. It
uses the same rules as the Header window, and these are:

        o The text is printed with no new lines
        o All text is printed to the printer
        o To print a new line use \n
        o To print a \ use \\
        o &name will print the name of the scale
        o &key will print the name of the key
        o &notes will print the notes in the scale
        o &symbols will print the key of the symbols used

For more information on printers see the Printer driver manual.



1.B Display Options
-------------------
        The way in which the scales can  be displayed on screen can be
changed in a number of  ways  by  selecting the 'Display Options' item
from the 'Scales' menu.

        A dialogue will appear allowing you  to change the pixel width
and height of the frets. This can be from 01 to 99 pixels.

        The number of frets can be  altered  from  01 to 24. This does
not include the open notes so when  1  fret is chosen - the first fret
and the open notes are displayed.

        The fret numbering refers to  the fret numbers displayed under
the graphical scales. The start fret refers to the first fret you want
numbered  this can be from 0 to 24. The Increment controls which other
frets  are numbered. If  the  increment  is  3  then  every third fret
(3,9,12,15,18,21,24) will be numbered.

        The miscellaneous box provides a  number  of buttons which can
be either highlighted (on) or clear (off). These are explained below:

        * ROOT - differentiate root note from other scale notes.
        * RELATIVE - also display the relative scale
        * NUMBERS - display the fret numbers
        * SCALE NAME - display the scale name in the information bar.
        * KEY NAME - display the current key in the information bar.

        The Notes box provides 3 buttons:

                CIRCLE  SQUARE  TEXT

        * CIRCLE displays the notes on the fretboard as circles.
        * SQUARE displays the notes on the fretboard as diamonds(!).
        * TEXT displays the notes on the fretboard by their name.

        (Circle Slows the displaying of the notes on-screen)


        Clicking on OK or pressing  'Return'  will  exit to the guitar
program with the current options. Clicking on CANCEL will exit without
using any changes input.

1.C Transposing the Scales
--------------------------
        Changing the key is simply  a  matter of selecting a different
Key from the Key menu. The current  key  will have a tick beside it so
changing to a new key involves clicking on a new item.

        The scale will be redrawn in the different key, and all future
scales will be displayed in this key until it is changed.

*******************
3.0 The text window
*******************

        The text window is  used  in  a  number  of  situations in the
program and it is  useful  to  know  how  it  works.  It  is used when
selecting a scale, deleting a scale, selecting a tuning, or deleting a
tuning.


        Basically the item to be  selected  can  be double clicked on.
This will select it, or delete it and exit the window.

        The vertical scroll bar can be  used  to  view the rest of the
options.

        Single clicking on an item will highlight it. If the window is
closed (exited) then this item will be selected.

        Any highlighted item can be  deselected  by pressing 'Undo' or
by single clicking on it again.

        The keyboard cursor keys  can  be  used  to  scroll around the
items. Pressing cursor down, will highlight and move to the next item.
Pressing cursor up will highlight the item above.

        The screen can be scrolled  by  moving  down off the bottom of
the screen or moving up of the  top. Pressing 'Shift' and cursor up or
cursor down will page up or down  the list. If any item is highlighted
when paging then the relative position will be maintained.

        Any  highlighted   item   can    be   selected   by   pressing
'Return'. 'Undo' will deselect it.

4.0 The program
***************

4.1 Defaults
------------
4.1.1  What are the defaults
        The defaults are all the changeable items in the program,
        things like note size, and the other display options, and
        the tuning options.

4.1.2  Saving the defaults
        The defaults can be saved by choosing 'Save Defs' from the
        'File' menu. The file selector appears and you type in the
        name of the file to save the defaults as.

4.1.3  Loading the defaults
        A defaults file can be loaded either by selecting 'Load Defs'
        from the 'File' menu. Or by setting the defaults path so that
        the file is loaded when the file is started. The next section
        explains this.


4.2 Paths
---------
4.2.1  What are the paths
        The Paths are the various files loaded in when the program is
        first run. The paths are stored in a file called 'PATHS.MAN'
        which must appear in the same directory as the main program.

        To see the currently set up paths and to change them click on
        'Paths' from the 'File' menu.

        The scales path identifies the scales file to load at run
        time.
        The tunings path identifies the tunings file to load at run
        time.
        The defaults path identifies the defaults file to load at run
        time.
        The printer path identifies the printer driver to load at run
        time.

4.2.2  Changing the paths.
        The paths can be altered by clicking on the path to change.
        The File selector will appear and the file to set the path to
        should be chosen.

        Once changed the OK button must be clicked in order for the
        program to recognise the changes.

        Please note that the changes will not take effect unless the
        program is reloaded.

4.2.3  Saving the paths
        The paths can be saved by clicking on the SAVE button. The
        program will automatically save the paths to the file called
        'PATHS.MAN' in  the program directory.

4.2.4  Loading the paths
        The paths are loaded from the 'paths.man' file when the
        program is run.


4.3 Starting the program
------------------------
        The program is started by  double clicking on the GUITAREF.PRG
icon or GUITAREF.PRG filename from the desktop.

        The program uses GEM  and  as  such  can  NOT  be  run from an
autofolder.

        The program is compatible with utilities such as HotWire which
allow running of programs with a few mouse clicks or keyboard presses.
If you do not have a program such as this then just start the program
from the desktop.

4.4 Quiting the program
-----------------------
        Quiting the program  is  done  by  selecting  'Quit'  from the
'File' menu bar. A dialogue will  appear  asking  you if you are sure.
Press Quit or Return to leave the   program. Cancel will return you to
the program.

4.5 About
---------
