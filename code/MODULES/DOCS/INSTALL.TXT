Installation Manual
-------------------

Hard drive Installation:
        Simply copy all the files and  folders into a directory on the
hard drive.

Floppy drive Installation:
        Make a backup of the supplied  disk and always use your backup
disk to run the program.


If you wish to alter the  configuration  in  some way then always make
sure that the  GUITAREF.PRG, PATHS.MAN, and SCALES.RSC  are  located  
in the same directory for the program to work correctly.


Configuring the program
-----------------------
Run the program from either  the  backup  disk  or  the hard drive and
choose the PATHS option in the Files menu.

You can now set up  the  Printer  path,  tuning  path, scales path and
defaults path. This is done  by  clicking  on  the  path file name and
choosing a path with the file selector.

Once all four paths have been set up choose the Save option.

The program can  then  be  restarted  and  the  correct  files will be
loaded.

Please note that these changes will not take effect until the program is
reloaded.
