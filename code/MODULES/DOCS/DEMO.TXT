This file explains the presence of DEMO.ZIP on the full version of the
Guitar Reference.

Since you are unable to distribute the full version of the Guitar 
Reference, which I would like to thank you once more for registering,
we have provided the demo version which you can freely distribute to all
your friends, bulletin boards, and ftp sites.

We hope that you will distribute only this file and not any other portion
of the full registered version of the Guitar Reference.

Thanks, and I hope you are enjoying the program.

Alan Richardson
