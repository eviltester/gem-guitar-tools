READ ME         for Testers
=======

You have been sent  this  program  either  because  you expressed some
interest in the  program  at  some  point  in  your  life, because you
volunteered to look at it, or simply  because I found your name in the
telephone directory.

No matter. If you do not wish  to  test  this program - then don't. If
you don't want to tell me that you don't wish to test it then don't.

However If you do then you  will  also receive further versions of the
program to test FREE OF CHARGE, yes indeedy.

WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
=====================

Use the program, that's all. Read the manuals, run the program, try to
break it and make notes.

If you find a bug, let me know.
If you don't understand anything, let me know.
If you don't like anything, let me know.
If you wouldn't use it, let me know.
If you want to see any features added then let me know.
If you think certain dialogues should be re-designed then let me know.

Anything that goes wrong,  anything  that  works brilliantly, anything
you don't like, anything you do. ANYTHING AT ALL.

But please,  be  honest,  no  false  platitudes  to  avoid  hurting my
feelings. I have no feelings with regards to this program - ok, that's
not true, I love it like an action man.

But If you have received this out of the blue and think it was rude of
me to send it then be as  rude  as  you  want. REMEMBER - I can ignore
comments, but i really don't want to.

THANKS
======

Yes thank you, at the very least for looking at this.

Obviously I can't impose time limits  for  getting comments back to me
but I would appreciate getting them  as quick as possible. The quicker
I get them back the quicker I can release the software.

One other thing. When you respond  could  you  give me details of your
setup. i.e Memory  sizes,  no  of  disks,  disk  capacity, hard drive,
monitors, printers, midi equipment, etc etc etc.

I can be contacted at:

Email   richara@uk.ac.wmin      or      richara@wmin.ac.uk

(Whichever one works  on  your  Email  Janet  etc  connection. I don't
understand this stuff , i just use it!)

OH and please don't  pass  copies  to  anyone  else, the program ISN'T
public domain, or shareware, or even  a commercial product, but I hope
to release it as licenseware. So  until  I  decide what to do with it,
please respect this one condition.

Thanks, Alan
