README.TXT for Guitar Reference Demo Version

The Demo version has a number of features disabled, saving & loading 
of scales, tunings, paths and defaults. Printing is available, but 
you may only print to disk. You CAN load printer drivers. This is done
by clicking on the driver name on the print dialogue.

This version of the Guitar Reference is shareware and may be 
distributed free of charge provided all files are provided, complete,
and in the original form.

If you like this program and would like to order the upto date full version 
then please read the REGISTER.TXT file supplied and follow the instructions
within.

The full version currently has 57 Scales in the database, and 46 Tunings.
Scales and tunings can be added and saved.

The Guitar Reference will be developed and upgraded as and when I need a 
new feature added. Unless of course I get support from happy, gleeful users.
Then I can work with an incentive.

Please do get in touch and tell me what features you would like to see
prioritised, ignored, bug fixed etcetera etcetera.


Thank you.
