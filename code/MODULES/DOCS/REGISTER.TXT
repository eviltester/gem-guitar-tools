The guitar reference is shareware. This file documents how you
can register your copy and obtain the full version or upgrade
your registered copy to the newest version.

Continued development can only be guaranteed by registering, otherwise
development proceeds according to the whims, needs and desires of the
programmer.

If you find the program useful then we hope you will register.

Registration
------------

The current version of the guitar reference is version 1.1

In order to register version 1 the base price is 5 pounds sterling.

This should be sent to:
        Denesh Bhabuta
        Dept. Al's Guitar stuff
        203 Parr Lane   
        Unsworth
        Bury    
        Lancashire
        Bl9 8JW   

cheques/postal orders drawn on a British Bank made payable to Denesh 
Bhabuta

For this you will receive the latest update of version 1, currently
this is version 1.1. This is the full version and allows the saving
and loading of scales and tunings. Also included are 57 scales and
46 tunings.

You will be notified by post when the next update is available. If you would
like to be notified of further versions then include a SAE (UK only) or 
increase the registration fee by 50 pence for each upgrade you would like to 
be notified for.

e.g

To be notified for 2 upgrades then either include a SAE (UK only) or 
increase the registration fee to 5.50 sterling. The first upgrade 
notification is free.

Upgrades
--------

o Minor Upgrades

Minor upgrades (e.g. moving from v1.0 to 1.1 or 1.3 etc) will be available
free as diff files on various ftp sites although the official site is

micros.hensa.ac.uk

These will come with full instructions on how to upgrade your software.

Minor upgrades will be available at a nominal charge (to cover costs) from:

        Denesh Bhabuta
        Dept. Al's Guitar stuff
        203 Parr Lane
        Unsworth
        Bury   
        Lancashire
        Bl9 8JW  

These will cost 2.50 and you will be sent the latest upgrade of the version 
you have registered.

If you are in the UK then you can send a SAE (Jiffy bag) and a blank disk
and it will be done free of charge.


o Major Upgrades

Major Upgrades ( moving from version 1 to version 2) will require an upgrade
fee. This will be cheaper than registering since the price of registering
the product will increase with each major version.

Major upgrades are projected to cost as follows:

        1 version upgrade (e.g 1 to 2, or 2 to 3):      5 pounds sterling
        2 version upgrade (e.g 1 to 3, or 2 to 4):      7.50 pounds sterling
        3 version upgrade (e.g 1 to 4):                 10 pounds sterling


We reserve the right to change these prices if we feel the need.

Registered users will receive notification of any price changes with their
update information.


o Upgrade notification

Notification of upgrades will be given free if you have an Email address.
Please include this when registering.

Otherwise UK notifications can be obtained free by enclosing SAEs with
your registration, or sending us a SAE after each notification.

For users outside the UK notification can be obtained by adding 50 pence
onto the registration fee for each notification required.

Please let us know if you would like to be notified only for major upgrades
or starting at a specific version etc

We will try to notify as many different sources as possible of upgrade 
information, e.g usenet, magazines, bulletin boards etc



Thanks

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand this document. We are
trying to keep the registration and upgrade prices low but we can only
do this with your help.

If you are not going to register at the moment, but think that you might 
if the program
had a certain feature or did something in a diferent way then please let us
know.
