Ehmm...and now to protect myself.

This program has been tested, and used extensively by the author. However
you use this program at your own risk. I take no resposibility for anything
happening to your machine, hard drive, disk collection, record collection,
front garden or garage while using this program. Should the world outside
your window start making hideous noises when you go to bed then I take
no responsibility for your loss of sleep. I take the blame for nothing.

The above paragraph has been written for my protection to avoid any
possible law suites. But on a friendly note, the program has been sitting
running on my hard drive for the last 6 or 7 months and nothing has gone
wrong yet.


Thanks
