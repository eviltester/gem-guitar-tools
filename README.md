Atari ST GEM Guitar Tools Reference

Wow, I didn't expect to find this.

Back in 1993 I wrote my first commercial tool. This Guitar Reference, written in 'C' for the Atari ST.

It didn't sell particularly well, but I thought it was pretty good for the time.

I thought I had lost the source code, but stumbled across it today. I can't remember what C compiler I used or anything like that.

Looking through the code I can see that I wrote my own very crude printer drivers. Ah, the good old days.
